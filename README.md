# üìà EMA Crossover Strategy Simulation for NIFTY 50

This Python script simulates a basic **EMA crossover trading strategy** for the **NIFTY 50** index using historical data. It demonstrates **buy/sell logic** based on 5-day and 9-day EMA crossovers, with a fixed **target profit** and **stop loss** mechanism.

---

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `yfinance`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas matplotlib
```

---

## üìä Strategy Logic

- **Buy Signal:** When 5 EMA crosses above 9 EMA.
- **Sell Signals:**
  - Target profit of **1.5%** reached.
  - Stop loss of **0.5%** triggered.
  - 5 EMA crosses back below 9 EMA (manual exit).

## üìå Example Output

```bash
Trade Log:

## üìâ Visualization

- Plots the **Close Price**, **EMA 5**, and **EMA 9**.
- Highlights trend direction and crossover points.

---

## üßê How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

1. Downloads historical NIFTY 50 data using `yfinance`.
2. Computes 5-day and 9-day EMAs.
3. Simulates trades based on crossover logic:
   - Entry on bullish crossover.
   - Exit on target, stop loss, or bearish crossover.
4. Maintains a trade log and calculates portfolio performance.
5. Plots the results for visual analysis.

---

## üìù Notes

- This is a **simulation**, not connected to any live trading platform.
- No trading fees/slippage are considered.
- Can be extended to real trading via broker APIs like **Dhan**, **Zerodha**, etc.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements (Optional Ideas)

- Add **backtesting metrics** (Win rate, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- Highlight buy/sell points on the chart.
- Use **candlestick** charts.
- Add **position sizing** and **risk management**.
